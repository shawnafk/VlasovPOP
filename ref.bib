    abstract = {Cyclotron radiation from electrons in the exosphere spiraling along a line of force away from the observer will appear at a frequency less than the local gyrofrequency. An electron traveling from the observer's hemisphere to the opposite hemisphere will radiate a decreasing frequency until it crosses the equator, and thence an increasing frequency. Propagation conditions and various particle speeds give frequency-time spectra similar to those observed. A method of scaling electron speeds and the field lines in which they occur from observed data is described. Tests of the theory are discussed.},

	abstract = {Chorus emission in planetary magnetospheres is taken as working paradigm to motivate a short tutorial trip through theoretical plasma physics methods and their applications. Starting from basic linear theory, readers are ﬁrst made comfortable with whistler wave packets and their propagation in slowly varying weakly non-uniform media, such as the Earth’s magnetosphere, where they can be ampliﬁed by a population of supra-thermal electrons. The nonlinear dynamic description of energetic electrons in the phase space in the presence of self-consistently evolving whistler ﬂuctuation spectrum is progressively introduced by addressing renormalization of the electron response and spectrum evolution equations. Analytical and numerical results on chorus frequency chirping are obtained and compared with existing observations and particle-in-cell simulations. Finally, the general theoretical framework constructed during this short trip through chorus physics is used to draw analogies with condensed matter and laser physics as well as magnetic conﬁnement fusion research. Discussing these analogies ultimately presents plasma physics as an exciting cross-disciplinary ﬁeld to study.},

	abstract = {The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the ﬁfth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs ﬁve identical micro-satellites (hereafter termed “probes”) which line up along the Earth’s magnetotail to track the motion of particles, plasma and waves from one point to another and for the ﬁrst time resolve space–time ambiguities in key regions of the magnetosphere on a global scale. The probes are equipped with comprehensive in-situ particles and ﬁelds instruments that measure the thermal and super-thermal ions and electrons, and electromagnetic ﬁelds from DC to beyond the electron cyclotron frequency in the regions of interest. The primary goal of THEMIS, which drove the mission design, is to elucidate which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset at the region where substorm auroras map (∼10 RE): (i) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current (current disruption) or (ii) the interaction of the current sheet with the rapid inﬂux of plasma emanating from reconnection at ∼25 RE. However, the probes also traverse the radiation belts and the dayside magnetosphere, allowing THEMIS to address additional baseline objectives, namely: how the radiation belts are energized on time scales of 2–4 hours during the recovery phase of storms, and how the pristine solar wind’s interaction with upstream beams, waves and the bow shock affects Sun–Earth coupling. THEMIS’s open data policy, platform-independent dataset, open-source analysis software, automated plotting and dissemination of data within hours of receipt, dedicated ground-based observatory network and strong links to ancillary space-based and ground-based programs. promote a grass-roots integration of relevant NASA, NSF and international assets in the context of an international Heliophysics Observatory over the next decade. The mission has demonstrated spacecraft and mission design strategies ideal for Constellation-class missions and its science is complementary to Cluster and MMS. THEMIS, the ﬁrst NASA micro-satellite constellation, is a technological pathﬁnder for future Sun-Earth Connections missions and a stepping stone towards understanding Space Weather.},

	abstract = {We propose a self-consistent theoretical framework of chorus wave excitation, which describes the evolution of the whistler fluctuation spectrum as well as the supra-thermal electron distribution function. The renormalized hot electron response is cast in the form of a Dyson-like equation, which is then manipulated to obtain evolution equations for nonlinear fluctuation growth and frequency shift. This approach allows us to analytically derive for the first time exactly the same expression for the chorus chirping rate originally proposed by Vomvoridis et al., 1982. Chorus chirping is shown to correspond to maximization of wave particle power exchange, where each individual wave belonging to the whistler wave packet is characterized by small nonlinear frequency shift. We also show that different interpretations of chorus chirping proposed in published literature have a consistent reconciliation within the present theoretical framework, which further illuminates the analogy with similar phenomena in fusion plasmas and free electron laser physics.},

	abstract = {The generation process of whistler-mode chorus emissions is analyzed by both theory and simulation. Driven by an assumed strong temperature anisotropy of energetic electrons, the initial wave growth of chorus is linear. After the linear growth phase, the wave amplitude grows nonlinearly. It is found that the seeds of chorus emissions with rising frequency are generated near the magnetic equator as a result of a nonlinear growth mechanism that depends on the wave amplitude. We derive the relativistic second-order resonance condition for a whistler-mode wave with a varying frequency. Wave trapping of resonant electrons near the equator results in the formation of an electromagnetic electron hole in the wave phase space. For a specific wave phase variation, corresponding to a rising frequency, the electron hole can form a resonant current that causes growth of a wave with a rising frequency. Seeds of chorus elements grow from the saturation level of the whistler-mode instability at the equator and then propagate away from the equator. In the frame of reference moving with the group velocity, the wave frequency is constant. The wave amplitude is amplified by the nonlinear resonant current, which is sustained by the increasing inhomogeneity of the dipole magnetic field over some distance from the equator. Chorus elements are generated successively at the equator so long as a sufficient flux of energetic electrons with a strong temperature anisotropy is present.},

We report here, for the first time, particle-in-cell simulations of bidirectional chirping of whistler waves in a uniform magnetic field and falling-tone-only chirping in an inhomogeneous field. Combined with previous simulations of rising-tone-only emissions, we demonstrate that the background magnetic field inhomogeneity is not required for chirping of chorus, but it plays a key role in determining the chirping direction. The findings of the present work also unveil the critical role of the dipole geometry of Earth's magnetic field in causing the statistical predominance of rising-tone chorus and the oblique propagation of falling-tone chorus.},

	abstract = {Chorus waves play an important role in energetic electron dynamics in the inner magnetosphere. In this work, we present a new hybrid code, DAWN, to simulate the generation of chorus waves. The DAWN code is unique in that it models cold electrons using linearized ﬂuid equations and hot electrons using particle-in-cell techniques. The simpliﬁed ﬂuid equations can be solved with robust and simple algorithms. We demonstrate that discrete chorus elements can be generated using the code. Waveforms of the generated element show amplitude modulation or “subpackets,” and the frequency sweep rate of the generated element is found to be consistent with that of observed chorus waves. Using the DAWN code, we then investigate the variation of wave intensity (∝ B2w) with respect to linear growth rates on the equatorial plane. Previous observations showed that the change in linear growth rates of whistler waves modulated by external processes such as density modulations is usually small ((10−1)), while the variation of the wave intensity is large ((101 − 102)). Using a chosen set of background plasma parameters, we demonstrate that a small change ((10−1)) in linear growth rates can lead to signiﬁcant variation ((101)) of wave intensity only in the transition from the broadband whistler wave generation regime to the chorus wave generation regime. Our results demonstrate the importance of including nonlinear dynamics of chorus generation in understanding the whistler wave intensity modulation process in the inner magnetosphere.},

The reduced model describes the weakly nonlinear dynamics of generic electrostatic instabilities and incorporates the self-consistent wave–particle interaction through a mean ﬁeld that couples the resonant particles to the amplitude of a single wave potential. Following a brief review of the SWM, we show numerical evidence of trapped and untrapped hole–clump dipole states for both symmetric and weakly asymmetric initial conditions. The rotation (in the trapped case) and translation (in the untrapped case) of the dipole manifest as periodic (in the case of symmetric states) and quasi-periodic (in the case of asymmetric states) time dependences of the potential that gives rise to self-consistent chaos. The role of chaotic mixing and hyperbolic–elliptic bifurcations in the relaxation of initial conditions far from equilibrium is also discussed.},

The effects of a nonlinear interaction between a whistler wave and the particles resonating with it are considered in some detail. The interaction gives rise to two closely related effects, namely a change in the amplification or absorption by the plasma, and a phase-bunching of the resonant and near-resonant particles, thus giving rise to a current. The current due to the phase-bunched particles has roughly the same structure (frequency and wave number) as the wave causing it, and will therefore give rise to emission of a new whistler wave, acting like an antenna. The possibility of having a self-sustained process of phase-bunching and emission is investigated. The structure of a region where this process can take place is proposed, and the corresponding conditions that must be met are stated.},

	abstract = {Whistler mode chorus waves are quasi-coherent electromagnetic emissions with frequency chirping. Various models have been proposed to understand the chirping mechanism, which is a long-standing problem in space plasmas. Based on analysis of effective wave growth rate and electron phase space dynamics in a self-consistent particle simulation, we propose a phenomenological model called the “Trap-Release-Amplify” (TaRA) model for chorus. In this model, phase space structures of correlated electrons are formed by nonlinear wave particle interactions, which mainly occur in the downstream of equator. When released from the wave packet in the upstream, these electrons lead to selective amplification of new emissions which satisfy the phase-locking condition to maximize wave power transfer, resulting in frequency chirping. The phase-locking condition at the release point gives a chirping rate that is, fully consistent with the one by Helliwell in case of a nonuniform background magnetic field. The nonlinear wave particle interaction part of the TaRA model results in a chirping rate that is, proportional to wave amplitude, a conclusion originally reached by Vomvoridis et al. Therefore, the TaRA model unifies two different results from seemingly unrelated studies. Furthermore, the TaRA model naturally explains fine structures of chorus waves, including subpackets and bandwidth, and their evolution through dynamics of phase-trapped electrons. Finally, we suggest that this model could be applied to explain other related phenomena, including frequency chirping of chorus in a uniform background magnetic field and of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in the magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {Some of the spectral forms (e.g. ‘inverted’ hook) of discrete VLF emissions are not explained satisfactorily by present theories of generation based simply on gyroresonance between energetic streaming electrons and whistler-mode waves traveling in the opposite direction. An extension of the gyroresonance idea is proposed in which the spatial variations of the electron gyrofrequency and the Doppler-shifted wave frequency are matched. The coupling time between a resonant electron and the wave is then maximized, and hence the output wave intensity is maximized. Application of this condition leads directly to an expression for the time rate of change of emission frequency in terms of the location of the interaction region. An approximate analysis of the postulated interaction process leads to a theorem that states: The magnetic field intensity is limited to a value less than that at which the bunching time approximately equals the resonance time. When the input particle flux exceeds the value required to account for this limiting value of wave intensity, the interaction region drifts downstream. If the interaction begins on the falling-tone or ‘upstream’ side of the equator, positive drift carries the interaction across the equator into the rising-tone region, giving rise to the well known ‘hook’ shape. Reversal of the drift, resulting from wave damping or other factors, carries the interaction back across the equator, giving rise to the inverted hook, a shape not explained by previous theories. Combinations of positive and negative drifts can explain the principal emission forms. The triggering delay and offset frequency of artificially triggered discrete VLF emissions can be explained by the theory.},

The non-linear equations of motion are investigated and it is found that resonant electrons become stably trapped in the wave, and because of the magnetic field inhomogeneity such particles undergo a steady change in energy and magnetic moment. Extensive computations of the non-linear resonant particle current are made for a wide variety of choices for the wave field. Invariably it was found that the current was due chiefly to the displacement in energy of a bunch of stably trapped particles. A self-consistent computer program is constructed which follows in detail the time development of a morse pulse as it crosses the Equator. The program uses a model prescription for the resonant particle current as a function of field that assumes that trapped particles are the dominant contributors. With a suitable choice of parameters it was found that the model produced long emissions of rising frequency very similar in appearance to those in reality. One run produced a steep faller, also very much like those observed. Finally a very long pulse was put into the model and one obtained slow pulsations in amplitude similar to those noted by Bell and Helliwell. Although the self-consistent program suffers from an inability to handle large amplitude sideband waves, and has to be very heavily smoothed, the results show convincingly that the non-linear trapping of electrons in an inhomogeneous medium is fully able to account for triggering instability.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear processes associated with the generation process of whistler-mode chorus emissions are summarized. The nonlinear dynamics of energetic electrons interacting with a coherent whistler-mode wave and the formation of electromagnetic electron holes or hills in the velocity phase space are described. The condition for resonant electrons to be free from the anomalous trapping at low pitch angles is obtained. In the presence of the inhomogeneity due to the frequency variation and the gradient of the magnetic field, the electron holes or hills result in resonant currents generating rising-tone emissions or falling-tone emissions, respectively. After formation of a coherent wave at a frequency of the maximum linear growth rate, triggering of the nonlinear wave growth takes place when the wave amplitude is above the threshold amplitude. The wave grows to a level close to the optimum wave amplitude as an absolute instability near the magnetic equator. The nonlinear growth rate at a position away from the equator is derived for a subtracted Maxwellian momentum distribution function with correction to the formulas in the past publications. The triggering process is repeated sequentially at progressively higher frequencies in the case of a risingtone emission, generating subpackets forming a chorus element. With a higher plasma density as in the plasmasphere, the triggering of subpackets takes place concurrently over a wide range of frequency forming discrete hiss elements with varying frequencies. The mechanism of nonlinear wave damping due to quasi-parallel propagation from the equator is presented, which results in the formation of a gap at half the electron cyclotron frequency, separating a long rising-tone chorus emission into the upper-band and lower-band chorus emissions. The theoretical formulation of an oblique whistler mode wave and its interaction with energetic electrons at the n-th resonance is also presented along with derivation of the inhomogeneity factor.},

	abstract = {Chorus emissions are triggered from the linear cyclotron instability driven by the temperature anisotropy of energetic electrons (10–100 keV) in the magnetosphere. Chorus emissions grow as an absolute nonlinear instability near the magnetic equator because of the presence of an electromagnetic electron hole in velocity space. The transition process from the linear wave growth at a constant frequency to the nonlinear wave growth with a rising tone frequency is due to formation of a resonant current −JB antiparallel to the wave magnetic field. The rising-tone frequency introduces a phase shift to the electron hole at the equator and results in a resonant current component antiparallel to the wave electric field −JE, which causes the nonlinear wave growth. To confirm this triggering mechanism, we perform Vlasov hybrid simulations with JB and without JB. The run without JB does not reproduce chorus emissions, while the run with JB does successfully reproduce chorus emissions. The nonlinear frequency shift ω1 due to JB plays a critical role in the triggering process. The nonlinear transition time TN for the frequency shift is found to be of the same order as the nonlinear trapping period, which is confirmed by simulations and observation. The established frequency sweep rate is ω1/TN, which gives an optimum wave amplitude of chorus emissions.},

The time for phase correlation is of the order of the period of oscillation of a particle in the effective ‘potential well’ of the wave. It is recognized that the wave acceleration due to the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the earth must be small enough for the particle to stay trapped in the potential well. The phase-correlated electrons are subject to an instability in the form of an emitted whistler with a growth rate γ/ω ∼ (n/no)2/5(υ⊥/c)2/5 (ωp/Ω)2/5, where (n/no) is the fractional density of the resonant particles, υ⊥ is their mean transverse velocity, and ωp and Ω are local cold plasma and gyrofrequencies.

We assume energetic electrons forming a highly anisotropic velocity distribution in the equatorial region. No initial wave is assumed except for electromagnetic thermal noise induced by the energetic electrons. In the early stage of the simulation, coherent whistler-mode waves are generated from the equator through an instability driven by the temperature anisotropy of the energetic electrons. During the propagation of the whistler-mode waves, we find formation of a narrowband emission with negative frequency gradient (NEWNFG) in the spatial distribution of the frequency spectrum in the simulation system. The trailing edge of NEWNFG is continuously created at increasing frequencies in the region close to the equator. Observed at a fixed point, the NEWNFG shows a frequency variation of a typical chorus emission.},

	abstract = {The ELF (10–1500 Hz) electromagnetic emissions in the midnight sector of the outer magnetosphere have been studied using Ogo 5 search coil magnetometer data. Chorus was detected in conjunction with magnetospheric substorms throughout the region from L = 5 to L = 9 but only during postmidnight hours. No chorus was seen in the 3 hr preceding midnight even when substorms were in progress. The postmidnight chorus occurred only within ±15° of, and most frequently at, the geomagnetic equator. Time-averaged intensities varied from 10−8 to 10−6 γ²/Hz, which is more than an order below the maximum values reported previously for dayside chorus. The chorus occurred in narrow frequency bands having a bandwidth of 50–200 Hz. Chorus frequencies varied from less than one-fourth to as high as three-fourths of the equatorial electron gyrofrequency as determined by the on-board magnetometer. All frequencies in this range were detected except for a narrow band near one-half the electron gyrofrequency where the chorus appeared to be strongly attenuated. Chorus was often observed as two distinct bands above and below one-half the gyrofrequency. The two most common types of chorus were narrow band chorus without structure and falling tones. Rising tones and hooks were also observed. Chorus pulsations were observed often with quasi-periods of 5–15 s. A correlation was sought, but none was found, between the micropulsations in the ambient magnetic field and the chorus pulsations. Many features of postmidnight chorus can be explained by a cyclotron resonant interaction between the waves and the substorm electrons. The distribution of the chorus as a function of local time and L is strikingly similar to the distribution of enhanced, trapped, and precipitated substorm electrons with energies {\textgreater}40 keV. The postmidnight occurrence of chorus is attributable to the eastward curvature and gradient drift of the injected electrons. Cyclotron resonant interactions should be strongest near the equator, as was observed. The confinement to within 15° of the equator is attributed to Landau damping by low-energy (1–10 keV) auroral electrons. The attenuation band at one-half the electron gyrofrequency may result from Landau damping by electrons that have energy corresponding to cyclotron resonance but are traveling in the same direction as the waves. A close correspondence is expected between the occurrence of postmidnight and dayside chorus. The maximum in dayside chorus intensity at approximately 1000 LT, which is correlated with the dayside maximum of energetic electron precipitation, may represent further precipitation of the substorm electrons injected near midnight.},

	abstract = {New characteristics of VLF chorus in the outer magnetosphere are reported. The study is based on more than 400 hours of broadband (0.3-12.5 kHz) data collected bv the Stanford University/Stanford Research Institute VLF experiment on OGO 3 during 1966-67. Bandlimited emissions constitute the dominant form of whistler-mode radiation in the region 4z L q 10. Magnetospheric chorus occurs mainly from 0300 to 1500 LT, at higher L at noon than at dawn, and moves to lower L during geomagnetic disturbance, in accord with ground observations of VLF chorus. Occurrence is moderate near the equator, lower near 15”, and maximum at high latitudes (far down the field lines). The centre frequency f of the chorus band varies as L-3 and at low latitudes is closely related to the electron gyrofrequency on the dipole field line through the satellite. Based on the measured local gyrofrequency fu, the normalized frequency distribution of chorus observed within 10” of the dipole equator shows two peaks, at flfu -0.53 and f\&, = 0.34. This bimodal distribution is a persistent statistical feature of near equatorial chorus, independent of L, LT and I\$,. However there is considerable variability in individual events, with chorus often observed above, below, and between these statistical peaks; in particular, it is not unusual for single emissions to cross f/fr, = 0.50. When two bands are simultaneously present individual emission elements only rarely show one-to-one correlation between bands. For low I\$, the median bandwidth of the upper band, gap and lower band are all -16\% of their centre frequencies, independent of L; for higher Kr the bandwidth of the lower band increases. Bandwidth also increases with latitude beyond -10”. Starting frequencies of narrowband emissions range throughout the band. The majority of the emissions rise in frequency at a rate between 0.2 and 2.0 kHz/sec; this rate increases with Kp and decreases with L. Falling tones are rarely observed at dipole latitudes {\textasciitilde}2.5”. The observations are interpreted in terms of whistler-mode propagation theory and a gyroresonant feedback interaction model. An exact expression is derived for the critical frequency, f/fH = 0.5, at which the curvature of the refractive index surface vanishes at zero wave normal angle. Near this frequency rays with initial wave normal angles between 0” and -20” are focused along the initial field line for thousands of km, enhancing the phase-bunching of incoming gyroresonant electrons. The upper peak in the bimodal normalized frequency distribution is attributed to this enhancement near the critical frequency, at latitudes of -5”. Slightly below the critical frequency interference between modes with different ray velocities may contribute to the dip in the bimodal distribution. The lower peak may reflect a corresponding peak in the resonant electron distribution, or guiding in field-aligned density irregularities. The observations are consistent with g\_y\_roresonant generation of emissions near the equator, followed by spreading of the radiation over a range of L shells farther down the field lines. .},

Parabolic variation of the static magnetic field is assumed as a model for the dipole magnetic field in the vicinity of the equator. We have cold thermal electrons and relatively low anisotropic hot electrons as plasma particles. In the initial phase, the amplitude growth of the incoherent whistler-mode waves is determined by the linear growth rate. When the wave amplitude reaches a certain level, it begins to grow more rapidly with a series of rising tone emissions consisting of coherent phase structures in the vicinity of the magnetic equator, and their wave packets propagate away form the magnetic equator. The frequency sweep rates of the excited rising tone elements decrease gradually. We find a distinct threshold for such a nonlinear wave growth generating the rising chorus-like elements. The relation between the wave amplitude and the frequency sweep rate of each element found in the simulation fully supports the nonlinear wave growth theory of chorus emissions.},
